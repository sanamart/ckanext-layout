# ckanext-layout

Extension to change CKAN's standard layout. In this case the block "Welcome to CKAN" is removed from the main page.


## Requirements

If your extension works across different versions you can add the following table:

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| <2.9            | not tested    |
| 2.9             |               |

## Installation

To install ckanext-layout:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example:

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    git clone https://github.com/sanamart/ckanext-layout.git
    cd ckanext-layout
    pip install -e .
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add `layout` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:

     sudo service apache2 reload

## Releasing a new version of ckanext-layout

If ckanext-layout should be available on PyPI you can follow these steps to publish a new version:

1. Update the version number in the `setup.py` file. See [PEP 440](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers) for how to choose version numbers.

2. Make sure you have the latest version of necessary packages:

    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

3. Create a source and binary distributions of the new version:

       python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine check dist/*

   Fix any errors you get.

4. Upload the source distribution to PyPI:

       twine upload dist/*

5. Commit any outstanding changes:

       git commit -a
       git push

6. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the `setup.py` file. For example if the version number in `setup.py` is
   0.0.1 then do:

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags
